# Course Google Certified
# Professional Cloud Network Engineer


# Overview

 Google Cloud Professional Cloud Network Engineer will help prepare you for the certification exam so you can demonstrate your ability to implement and manage network architectures on Google Cloud Platform.
	
These are deployment files for the course labs.  They utiltize the steps from GoogleCloudPlatform/Cloud-foundation-toolkit.
In order to guarantee these files continue to be compatible with the course in the cloud-foundation-toolkit, Forked a version of the cloud-foundation-toolkit here.  Will not update or maintain these tools only the course files using them.

Course files will be created by Chatper, and will be setup to reference the project name and folders paths.  


I would love to make this a place where overs can contribute networking project ideas.  Create a community folder, where you can upload network designs for GCP to share with others, for review and learning together.

If you need a reason to get on github and write some code, join me.  Lets make it a weekly meet online.
