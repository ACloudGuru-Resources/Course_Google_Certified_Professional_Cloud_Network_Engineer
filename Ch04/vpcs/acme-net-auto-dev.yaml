# Example of the network template usage.
#
# In this example, a network is created. Subnetworks can be created
# via the `subnetworks` property of the `network.py` template (such as 
# test-subnetwork-1)
#
# Note that the `name` property of the `templates/network.py` resource type is
# optional. If omitted, the DM resource name is used.
